# ESP32_Automated_Doorlock_System
This project implements a secure, automated door lock system using LoRa communication and ESP32 microcontrollers. Designed for apartment complexes, the system unlocks doors remotely and keeps track of which units responded. It is optimized for low-power, long-range communication and scalable to hundreds of units.
